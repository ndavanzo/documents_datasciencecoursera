This document is a generic overview about the data scientist's skills and attitudes.

What do data scientists do?

- Define the **questions of interest**
- Define the **ideal data set**
- Determine what **data you can access**
- **Obtain** the data
- **Clean** the data
- Exploratory **data analysis**
- **Statistical prediction/modeling**
- **Interpret** results
- **Challenge** results
- **Synthesize/write up** results
- Create **reproducible code**
- **Distribute** results to other people

Data Scientists tools:

 - R (statistical programming environment)
 - GitHub (Git repository web-based hosting service)
 - Terminal Linux

R questions:

- What steps will reproduce the problem?
- What is the expected output?
- What do you see instead?
- What version of the product are you using?
- What operating system?

Data analysis questions:

- What is the question you are trying to answer?
- What steps/tools did you use to answer it?
- What did you expect to see?
- What do you see instead?
- What other solutions have you thought about?

Data analysis files:

* Data (Raw Data, Processed Data)
* Figures (Explorator figures, Final figures)
* R code (Raw scripts, Final scripts, R markdown files)
* Text (Readme files, Text of analysis)

Command Line Interface (CLI):

* **Navigate** folders
* **Create** file, folders and programs
* **Edit** file, folders and programs
* **Run** computer programs

CLI commands: **command** **flags** **arguments**

* pwd
* clear
* ls -al
* cd
* mkdir
* touch
* cp -r
* rm -r
* mv new_file renamed_filed
* echo
* date

Git: open-source version control system

* most popular
* **local** repository
* command line
* git config - -global user.name " your_user_name "
* git config - -global user.email " your_email@example.com "
* git config - -list


GitHub: web-based hosting service for software development project that use the Git revision control system

* **Remote** repository (on the web)
* Homepage repository **display**
* **Backup**
* **Follow** (access) and **share**

Creating GitHub repository:

* from **Scratch**: " create a new repo "
* **Local copy**: 
git init
git remote add origin https://www.github.com/YourUsernameHere/test_repo.git

* **Fork** another user's repository: "Fork"
* **Clone the repo**:
git clone https://www.github.com/YourUsernameHere/RepoNameHere.git
