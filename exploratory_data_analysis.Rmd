**Principles for Analytic Graphics**

* Show comparisons
* Show causality, mechanism, explanation
* Show multivariate data
* Integrate multiple modes of evidence
* Describe and document the evidence
* Content is king

**Exploratory Graphs**

* Exploratory plots are "quick and dirty"
* Let you summarize the data (usually graphically) and highlight any broad features
* Explore basic questions and hypotheses (and perhaps rule them out)
* Suggest modeling strategies for the "next step"

**Plotting Systems in R**

* Base: "artist's palette" model
* Lattice: Entire plot specified by one function; conditioning
* ggplot2: Mixes elements of Base and Lattice

**Base Plotting System**

* Plots in the base plotting system are created by calling successive R functions to "build up" a plot
* Plotting occurs in two stages: 1) creation of a plot; 2) annotation of a plot (adding lines, points, text, legends)
* The base plotting system is very flexible and offers a high degree of control over plotting

**Graphics Devices in R**

* Plots must be created on a graphics device
* The default graphics device is almost always the screen device, which is most useful for exploratory data analysis
* File devices are useful for creating plots that can be included in other documents or sent to other people
* For file devices, there are vector and bitmap formats:
        1) Vector formats are good for line drawings and plots with solid colors using a modest number of points
        2) Bitmap formats are good for plots with a large number of points, natural scenes or web-based plots

**Lattice Plotting System**

Lattice plotting system is implemented using the following package:

* lattice: cointains code for producing Trellis graphics
* grid: implements a different graphic system independent of the "base" graphics system

All plotting/annotation is done at once with a single function call.

Lattice functions

* *xyplot*: this is the main function for creating scatterplots
* *bwplot*: boxplots
* *histograms*
* *stripplot*: boxplot with actual points
* *dotplots*: plots dots on "violin strings"
* *splom*: scatterplot matrix
* *levelplot* e *counterplot*: for plotting "image" data

Lattice panel function

* controls what happens inside each panel of the plot
* both default and custom
* receives the x/y coordinates of the data points in their panel√π

**ggplot2**

*qplot()* function:

* analog to *plot()* but with many built-in features
* syntax somewhere in between base/lattice
* produces very nice graphics, essentially pubblication ready
